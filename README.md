These are all the important dotfiles I need!

## Installation 

1. Clone this repo to `~/.` 
2. Run `./make_symlinks.sh` to create symlinks at required locations

## Removal

1. Run `./clear_symlinks.sh` to remove any config from this folder; junk may still be left over from installations though!

> Note that things like `zsh`  and `tmux` require additional steps to install; look at the necessary guides (or error messages lol) for that!
